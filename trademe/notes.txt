1. write search_without_async()
---DONE
1.5 write make_url()
---DONE
2. give it a quick go in scratch.ipynb (make sure to set the driver settings to not be headless for this bit)
- it handles pagination great now!!!
- looks like it's getting perfect HTML
- BUT keeps complaining that i'm passing 2 positional args into premium listing constructor instead of 1.
3. if good, start on the unit tests
3.5. note somewhere that you need to learn asyncio and write an async version.
4. if that's good, work on actually applying the project now.

other notes: might be valid to have a "stop_page" arg for some of our methods. 
^ e.g. if stop_page=3, you stop after having gotten source from page 3.
